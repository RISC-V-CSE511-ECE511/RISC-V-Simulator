# RISC-V Simulator

A simple RISC-V-Simulator for CSE511/ECE511 Computer Architecture course


## Setting Up Dev Environment

If you have docker and vscode, then the entire development environment can be spun up in a matter of clicks.

vscode upon opening the folder will automatically detect `.devcontainer` folder and request you to open the folder in a container. Once the folder is opened in the container, all the necessary vscode extensions will be set up automatically and you can start working on the code right away


### Extensions Required

The following extension must be installed in vscode for devcontainers to work.
